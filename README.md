# Algo-zoo

This is the repository for [algo-zoo](https://algo-zoo.com), a website for algorithm and data structure visualizers.

The visualizer programs are `.res` files in the `rescript` directory. Some programs remain in JavaScript, and these are planned to be migrated to ReScript.

This website uses the following libraries:

- [Flowbite](https://flowbite.com/)
- [function-plot](https://mauriciopoppe.github.io/function-plot/)
- [glfx](https://evanw.github.io/glfx.js/)
- [Hull.js](https://andriiheonia.github.io/hull/)
- [jQuery](https://jquery.com/)
- [KaTeX](https://katex.org/)
- [p5.js](https://p5js.org/)
